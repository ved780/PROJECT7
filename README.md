# Task 7 – Browser Extension Security Review

This repository contains my work for **Task 7** of the Cybersecurity Internship program.  
The goal of this task was to learn how to identify, assess, and remove suspicious browser extensions to improve overall security and privacy.

---

## 📌 Objective
To understand the security risks posed by browser extensions, learn how to evaluate them based on permissions and developer trustworthiness, and practice removing those that could be harmful.

## 📂 Repository Contents
- **Task7_Browser_Extension_Report.txt** – Detailed report of the extensions reviewed, risks identified, and actions taken.
- **Screenshots/** – Evidence of extensions installed, permissions viewed, and removal actions.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Web Browsers:** Google Chrome / Mozilla Firefox  
- **Extension Stores:** Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons  
- **Research Sources:** Official extension pages, user reviews, security blogs

## 🔍 Summary of Work
1. Checked the browser’s extensions manager – initially found no installed extensions.
2. Installed a mix of **useful** and **potentially harmful** extensions for analysis.
3. Reviewed each extension’s permissions, ratings, update history, and developer details.
4. Identified high-risk extensions and removed them.
5. Documented the process with findings and best practices.

## 📖 Key Takeaways
- Always verify the source and developer before installing any extension.
- Review permissions carefully – especially “read and change all your data on websites you visit.”
- Regularly audit installed extensions and remove those you no longer use.
- Even “free” extensions may trade user data for revenue.
