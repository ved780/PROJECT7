Cybersecurity Internship – Task 7
Interview Questions & Answers

1. How can browser extensions pose security risks?
Extensions can request access to sensitive data such as browsing history, passwords, and site content. Malicious ones can steal information, inject ads, track activity, or redirect users to harmful websites.

2. What permissions should raise suspicion?
- "Read and change all your data on websites you visit"
- Access to browsing history
- Permissions unrelated to the extension’s function
- Background activity without clear purpose

3. How to safely install browser extensions?
Only use official extension marketplaces, check developer reputation, read recent reviews, verify update history, and avoid installing extensions with unnecessary permissions.

4. What is extension sandboxing?
Sandboxing limits what an extension can access or do, isolating it from sensitive areas of the browser and operating system to reduce the impact of a security breach.

5. Can extensions steal passwords?
Yes, if given permission to read website data, they can capture login credentials entered into forms or stored in the browser. This is why reviewing permissions is critical.

6. How to update extensions securely?
Enable automatic updates from the official store, or manually check for updates. Avoid downloading updates from unofficial sources.

7. Difference between extensions and plugins?
- Extensions: Lightweight add-ons that modify browser behavior or add features (e.g., ad blockers).
- Plugins: External software that allows the browser to handle specific content (e.g., Flash Player). Plugins are less common now due to security risks.

8. How to report malicious extensions?
Report directly through the browser’s official extension store page using the "Report" option, or submit a complaint to the browser vendor’s security team.
