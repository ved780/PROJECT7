Browser Extension Security Report

Internship Task: 7 – Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions
Intern Name: Ved Vyas
Date: 14/08/2025

1. Introduction
The purpose of this task was to review browser extensions, evaluate their permissions, and remove those that could pose security risks. Since my browser initially had no installed extensions, I installed both useful and potentially harmful extensions to analyze their behavior and security implications.

2. Methodology
1. Checked the Extensions / Add-ons Manager – confirmed no extensions were initially installed.
2. Installed a few known useful extensions (e.g., password manager, ad blocker) and potentially suspicious extensions from official and third-party sources for testing purposes.
3. For each extension, reviewed:
   - Permissions requested
   - Reviews and ratings from the store
   - Last update date
4. Identified red flags such as:
   - Overly broad permissions without a clear purpose
   - Poor ratings or security complaints
   - Unknown developers or unverified sources
5. Removed harmful or unnecessary extensions after testing.
6. Restarted browser to observe performance improvements.

3. Findings

Extension Name       | Purpose         | Permissions Requested                      | Risk Level | Action Taken
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
uBlock Origin        | Ad blocker     | Access to all websites (content filtering)  | Low        | Kept
LastPass             | Password manager | Access to saved passwords, autofill forms | Low        | Kept
Free VPN Unlimited   | VPN service    | Read/change all data on websites, track usage | High     | Removed
Shopping Saver Pro   | Price tracker  | Modify data on visited websites, inject ads | High     | Removed
Dark Reader          | Dark mode      | Change website appearance                   | Low        | Kept

4. Observations
- Even extensions from official stores can request high-risk permissions.
- Some “free” tools like VPNs and coupon finders monetize by selling browsing data.
- Useful extensions like ad blockers and dark mode can improve privacy and comfort without major security risks, provided they’re from trusted developers.

5. Security Risks of Malicious Extensions
- Stealing personal data such as login credentials and browsing history.
- Injecting ads or malicious code into legitimate websites.
- Redirecting users to phishing or scam sites.
- Tracking online activity for targeted advertising or malicious intent.

6. Best Practices for Safe Extension Management
- Only install from verified, official extension marketplaces.
- Review requested permissions before installing.
- Keep extensions updated.
- Regularly review and remove unused ones.
- Research any extension before installing it, especially if it’s from an unfamiliar developer.

7. Conclusion
By testing both useful and suspicious extensions, I gained a clear understanding of how permissions, update frequency, and developer reputation affect security. The process highlighted the importance of regular browser extension audits and being selective about installations.
